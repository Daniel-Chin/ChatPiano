# ChatPiano
Chat Piano is an innovative project that leverages large AI models, such as ChatGPT and LaMDA 3.1, to create a system where users can interact with the AI using voice commands to generate MIDI files. This project aims to bridge the gap between AI and music production, making it easier for users to create music through simple text commands.
